    "- Each night:\n",
    "    - The Werewolves discuss and vote on a player to eliminate\n",
    "    - The Witch is told what player the wolves voted to eliminate, and is given the choice to use their potion of healing to reserruct the eliminated player, or use their poison to eliminate another player. Note that each power can only be used once in a game\n",

The primary (and mostly only) source of focus should be the reply the function in the agent class as that controls what an agent uses to generate a response, particular when we are working with different architectures, eg. how we use memory, single vs multi agent, we make those edits here."
